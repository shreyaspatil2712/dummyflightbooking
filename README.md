# dummyflightbooking

This is a simple script to simulate the booking of tickets through a python command-line interface. I'm still learning Python so the code might be a little messy but it works. Open to suggestions


To run this script you need pyhton3.9 installed on your device along with selenium and chromedriver configured.

You can install selenium by entering 'pip install selenium' in command promt / line.

You also have to download chromedriver.exe from 'https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads' according to your chrome version.

Further you hadve to add the chromedriver.exe in PATH from environment variables. 

To access environment variables Open the Start Search, type in “env”, and choose “Edit the system environment variables” →Click the “Environment Variables…” button→ click on Path → edit → add the path/location fo the chromedrive.exe file
